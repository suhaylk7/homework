        <h2>The Impact on Biodiversity and Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>The effects of climate change are not limited to human societies; the natural world is also being heavily impacted. Rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns threaten ecosystems and the species that depend on them. For example, coral reefs, which are sensitive to temperature changes, are experiencing widespread bleaching and die-offs due to warmer ocean waters. Similarly, animal species that rely on specific climates are struggling to adapt. Polar bears, for example, are facing habitat loss as Arctic sea ice melts, and many migratory bird species are being forced to change their travel patterns due to altered seasonal cues.</p>
        <p>The loss of biodiversity poses a significant threat to global food security and the stability of ecosystems. Many plants, insects, and animals play critical roles in pollination, pest control, and other natural processes that humans rely on. As species go extinct or are forced to relocate, these essential services may be disrupted, leading to unforeseen consequences.</p>
