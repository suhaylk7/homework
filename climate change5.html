        <h2>Mitigating Climate Change: What Can Be Done?</h2>
        <p>Addressing climate change requires global cooperation and concerted efforts from individuals, businesses, and governments. One of the most important actions is reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, can help replace fossil fuels, which are the main source of CO2 emissions. Additionally, energy efficiency measures, such as better insulation in buildings and cleaner transportation options, can reduce the overall energy demand.</p>
        <p>Reforestation and sustainable land-use practices are also critical in mitigating climate change. Protecting and expanding forests can help absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and provide habitats for wildlife. Furthermore, adopting sustainable agricultural practices, such as no-till farming and organic techniques, can reduce the carbon footprint of food production.</p>
        <p>Governments play a crucial role in tackling climate change through policy and international agreements. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. While progress has been made, much more needs to be done to achieve these goals. Investment in green technologies, carbon pricing, and stronger environmental regulations are key strategies for addressing climate change at the policy level.</p>
