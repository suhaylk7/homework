        <h2>The Importance of Adaptation</h2>
        <p>In addition to mitigation, adaptation is an essential component of addressing climate change. Communities around the world must prepare for the impacts of climate change that are already happening. This includes investing in infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events, such as flood-resistant buildings and stormwater management systems. Coastal cities, for example, may need to build seawalls or elevate structures to protect against rising sea levels.</p>
        <p>Additionally, governments must develop and implement strategies for managing migration due to climate impacts. This may involve creating policies to support displaced populations, as well as ensuring that vulnerable communities have access to resources and support to adapt to changing conditions.</p>
